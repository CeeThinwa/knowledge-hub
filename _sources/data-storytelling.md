# Welcome to Data Storytelling!

People generally need to go beyond the jargon because, a mentioned earlier, we are increasingly working with apps and websites that make use of machine learning and artifical intelligence.

Human beings *naturally* respond to **compelling narrative**.

They also *naturally* respond to **beautiful visuals**.

Additionally, they *naturally* respond to **captivating sound**.

So how can we combine what human beings gravitate to with data analysis and modelling results?

That's where **data storytelling** comes in.

Data Storytelling is
1. *Relating* the data problem to audience *pain points*,
2. *Presenting* analysis and modelling results as audience *solutions*,
3. *Discovering* how the analysis and/or model work/s under the hood in *relatable language and stories*,
4. *Mobilizing* the audience to make *objective decisions* and take *decisive actions* that make sense in their context.

It leverages stories communicated beautifully and simply through a variety of mediums for organizational, community, national and global impact.
It is dominant in Infographic Design, Data Science, Business Intelligence and Data Analysis.

A couple of data stories that I shared in the past include
