:::{admonition} What do customers think of Alexa?
:class: tip
<u>_**Project Summary**_</u>

When Amazon customers purchase an Amazon Alexa, a voice controlled-assistant,
some of them may chose to leave a review and give the product a rating. The rating ranges from 1 star
to 5 stars. A sample of 3,150 customer reviews
(data source [here](https://go.aws/2WkOfZp)) were selected for analysis.
Help Amazon solve the following challenges:
1. It's been discovered that all verified_reviews that are only say "love it" or are only one word are actually fake. Reviews like "great!" or "Love It!" need to be removed from the dataset.
2. We need to see the number of customers that left a review each day from the sample reviews that we do have
3. We need to see the number of reviews classified by rating
