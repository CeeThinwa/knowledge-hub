# Real world machine learning

Real world data (aka data in the wild) tends to be messy, unstructured and sporadically captured. As such, it is not enough to know
about computer vision, natural language processing, data storytelling and data pipelining concepts, it is important to actually apply
them.

Having static data pipelining, computer vision and natural language processing is enough to build a sophisticated robot. However, this robot will need tons
upon tons of data to be cleaned and organized by humans before it even comes to be. However, because of the nature of real world data,
the output of our robot will still need to be corrected by humans, even as its mechanical parts are serviced by humans.

To complement the two applied areas of machine learning, we need data storytelling and dynamic data pipelining. Deploying machine learning models into the
world can be incredibly complex, but nothing beats trying to

* identify concept and model drift
* systematically analyze error and optimize models
* explain how everything works to key stakeholders to build trust
* add new data sources into the data pipeline and removing 'stale' data
* teach new people how to use the application housing the model

AT THE SAME TIME.

This can get very complicated, as shown in the visual below:
