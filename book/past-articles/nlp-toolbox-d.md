*This is the fourth post of a five-part series where I aim to demystify Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a key learning tool that I would call the **NLP toolbox**. You can access the first article [here](https://medium.com/@ceethinwa/delivering-success-in-natural-language-processing-projects-part-one-40c4775cf6a9).*

What a ride! We got to explore both types of NLP data and visualize them in the previous section. Before we move any further, based on the last three parts, itâ€™s clear to see that:

1. **Problem Identification** is a *process* of recognizing *valuable* problems that are *hard* for most people but *easy* to solve when *technology* and *creativity* are combined.
2. **Data Exploration** is a *process* of *analyzing* the data to find *patterns* within it and *summarize* key characteristics of the data.
