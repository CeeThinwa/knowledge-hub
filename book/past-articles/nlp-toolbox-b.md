*The metaphorical toolbox in all its glory...*

*This is the second post of a four-part series where I aim to demystify Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a key 
learning tool that I would call* **the NLP toolbox**. *You can access the first article
[here](https://medium.com/@ceethinwa/delivering-success-in-natural-language-processing-projects-part-one-40c4775cf6a9).*

A quick recap:

* Though algorithms are increasingly controlling our day-to-day, only a few people can create and/or understand them.
* Mental scaffolding is useful to help more people understand algorithms and manage technical projects.
* The NLP toolbox can help us manage NLP projects and map out NLP concepts that we need to understand in order to fairly assess these projects.
* The NLP toolbox is **a collection of concepts, tools and ideas available for building applications that can handle real-world challenges around understanding content from all over the world**.

[The scientific research method](https://uedufy.com/the-scientific-method-definition-steps-role-in-research/) is a classic
go-to for structuring any research project, while the [CRISPR-DM](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/crisp-dm-a-standard-methodology-to-ensure-a-good-outcome/)
framework helps data scientists bring their projects to life. The NLP toolbox is meant to help strike the delicate balance between

* taking the time to deeply study a phenomenon and
* rapidly skim through relevant work

in order to apply scientific findings to the fast-paced world of business, adapted to rapidly changing consumer needs and wants.

There are therefore 4 stages in the research process where we can apply the NLP toolbox:

1. Problem Definition
2. Data Exploration
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Fitting and Evaluation

### Problem Definition

Imagine dealing with a whole bunch of bouncy beach balls like these ones that have to be put in a net for storage:

![bouncy beach balls](../images/beach-balls-1.svg)<br>
*All the bouncy beach balls that you have to catch.*

Thatâ€™s how it can feel sometimes identifying a problem that can be solved through NLP. We have to consider these 5 elements and combine them well:

1. Pain
2. Accessibility
3. Specificity
4. Interest
5. Location and Population

#### Round 1 of Questions

To start off, reflect on the questions under each element below and write down your initial and/or gut responses;
