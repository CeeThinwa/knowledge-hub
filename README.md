# Welcome to my Website Repo!

*I am passionate about impactful marketing research through Machine Learning & Data Science.*

**MY BIG QUESTION: How can we make more organizations competitive and sustainable?**

The world of people is complex and I’m here to use data to make sense of it all using compelling stories online.

I use machine learning and data science to solve tough problems that the organizations of today face, be they big or small. I use data visualizations and presentations to make hard technical concepts simple.

I blend HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, R, Markdown and PowerBI with copywriting, design, public speaking and teaching skills.

I’m open to research and data positions; let’s talk opportunities at [ceethinwa@gmail.com](mailto:ceethinwa@gmail.com).
